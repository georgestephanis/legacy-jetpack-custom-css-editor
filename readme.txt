This plugin re-adds the full page admin Custom CSS editor to Jetpack.

== Description ==

This plugin re-adds a standalone editing page for Custom CSS
in the WordPress Admin UI, for users that aren't comfortable
using the one in the Customizer.

Currently it only works with Jetpack and Jetpack's added features,
but shortly it will work without Jetpack as well, providing a
more basic text editor without syntax highlighting.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.1 =
* Add Full screen link to the CSS editor in the customiser.

= 0.9 =
* Preview works, powered by the Core Customizer's data store.

= 0.1.1 =
* Minor tweaks to iron out a few trivial php warnings.

= 0.1 =
* Initial Release.
